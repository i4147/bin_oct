"""Split a text file into sentences and words with blingfire and print the words.
A tiny driver for ``blingfire_compat.text_to_sentences``/``text_to_words``; the sentence list is computed as well but only the word list is printed.
Usage: bf_nlp FILE Examples: $ bf_nlp article.txt Runs as a script (``python bf_nlp.py``) in the directory it should act on; the module can also be imported."""
