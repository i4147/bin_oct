"""Re-encode every text file below the current directory as UTF-8 with LF line endings.
Walks plain files and the members of the archives it can open (through ``archive_walker``), skips binary data (NUL bytes), decodes as UTF-8 with a Latin-1 fallback, normalizes CRLF/CR to LF and writes the file back only when something changed.
Usage: dos2utf-8 Examples: $ dos2utf-8 Runs as a script (``python dos2utf-8.py``) in the directory it should act on; the module can also be imported."""
