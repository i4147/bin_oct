"""Unpack the ``.whl``/``.zip`` archives of a directory in place.
Extracts every wheel below the given directory into the same folder and deletes the archive, keeping the original when it is not a valid ZIP or cannot be written.
Usage: uzz [DIRECTORY] Examples: $ uzz ~/wheels Runs as a script (``python uzz.py``) in the directory it should act on; the module can also be imported."""
