Add useful comments and docstrings to the Python files in this repository.
First, inspect the repository structure and read its contribution guidelines, style configuration,
and existing documentation conventions.
Then work through the Python files in small batches.
After each batch, summarize the files updated and any issues before moving on.
### Guidelines
- Add a brief module docstring to each Python script or module that lacks one.
  It should clearly explain what the script or module does.
- Add docstrings to public classes and functions/methods that lack them.
  Follow the project’s existing style; if none is established, use Google-style docstrings.
- Describe parameters, return values, exceptions,
  and side effects when they are relevant and not obvious.
- Add comments only where they clarify non-obvious logic, constraints, assumptions,
  or important trade-offs.
  Don’t narrate straightforward code.
- Preserve behavior exactly.
  Do not refactor, rename, reorder, or otherwise modify executable logic.
- Don’t add redundant, speculative, or misleading documentation.
  Keep existing accurate comments and docstrings;
  correct them only if they clearly conflict with the code.
- Avoid documenting private helpers unless their behavior
  or constraints would otherwise be hard to understand.
- Follow the repository’s formatting, linting, and line-length rules.
At the end of each batch, review the diff to confirm the changes are documentation-only,
then report the files changed and any checks run.
If you find behavior that is unclear, leave it undocumented and flag it for me rather than guessing.
After all batches are complete, run the relevant formatting, lint, and test checks if available.
Provide a final summary of files changed, checks run, skipped files,
and anything that needs my input.
Do not commit or push changes.
