"""Run ``ruff format`` on the extension-less scripts below the current directory.
Walks the tree, skips symlinks and ``.git`` and formats every file without a suffix (the usual Python scripts in a ``bin`` folder) with ruff.
Usage: ruffbin Examples: $ ruffbin Runs as a script (``python ruffbin.py``) in the directory it should act on; the module can also be imported."""
