"""Repair relative links in Markdown and HTML files against a static directory.
Walks the current directory, and for every ``href`` whose target does not exist locally but does exist under ``/sdcard/_static`` rewrites the link to the absolute path.
The original file is kept as ``.bak``.
Usage: fix_html_md_broken_links Examples: $ fix_html_md_broken_links Runs as a script (``python fix_html_md_broken_links.py``) in the directory it should act on; the module can also be imported."""
