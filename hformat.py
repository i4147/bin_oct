"""Re-indent HTML files with BeautifulSoup's pretty printer.
Parses each file (the arguments, or every ``.html`` file below the current directory) and rewrites it with ``soup.prettify()`` only when the formatting changed.
Files are handled in parallel.
Usage: hformat [files ...] Examples: $ hformat index.html Runs as a script (``python hformat.py``) in the directory it should act on; the module can also be imported."""
